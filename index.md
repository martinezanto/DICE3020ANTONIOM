# Introduction 
In today’s world, the threat of hackers and information security has begun to become more and more of an issue. Everyday people’s personal information is stolen. Encryption and cyber security have become a way to fight against these hackers. As it turns out the most effective way to keep information stolen from hackers is to keep your documents or papers in physical form. But another way that hackers cannot steal your information, is if the information they steal is non-readable. Back in earlier societies images meant certain words of phrases, they had meaning. These images can be a way of encrypting information. For this assignment I initially wanted to use hieroglyphics as a way for of encryption, but from outside sources this was determined to be flawed. In this website and assignment, I plan to explain a single hieroglyphic and its ability to be used today for an encryption company’s logo. This specific logo is the Eye of Horus. 

# Why the Eye of Horus and Hieroglyphs? 
The reason that I chose to research and implement the Eye of Horus into my project and logo is that the eye is one of the most popular symbols of hieroglyphics. “Known also as the Wadjet, this magical symbol is believed to provide protection, health, and rejuvenation.”  The key point behind encryption is to protect people or company’s data from being stolen or used for other purposes. Not only does the eye mean protection, but hieroglyphics themselves encrypt their meaning. Unless you know how to read hieroglyphics there is no way to read them. The civilization ended many years before people were able to spread their meaning around the world. Only recently have people began to widely understand them. What is nice about these hieroglyphs is that computer programs would not be able to use their algorithms on them. Since they are not actual words, the computer programs would not pick them up. This adds another level of security; computer programs can’t read them, and neither can people. The information is very secure when encrypted with hieroglyphs. Of course, eventually hackers would be able to get around this issue, by creating new software. Using hieroglyphs as an encryption themselves would not be affective for an extended period, but the symbolism behind hieroglyphs still gives the idea or thought of unknown and secret. Which is the way that encryption companies want to keep their customers data.

# Historical Context (200-300 words)
The creation and implementation of the hieroglyph was by the ancient Egyptians. The language was composed of logograms which represent words, phonograms representing sound, and determinatives which are located at the end of the word to clarify meaning.  History believes that these drawing originated from hunting civilizations in the desert of the west Nile. But they also believe the god Thoth created the writing to make the Egyptians able to retain their knowledge and culture over time. “Thus, the word hieroglyph comes from the Greek hiero ‘holy’ and the glypho ‘writing’. In the ancient Egyptian language, hieroglyphs were called medu netjer, the gods ‘words’ as it was believed that writing was an invention of the gods.”   The Egyptians are famous for their pottery and burial rituals, these objects often had hieroglyphs on them to tell their story. In its early existence often, these hieroglyphs were carved on rectangular wood or ivory for jewelry. They were are also put on stone, metal, and ceramic for their burial rituals. The most common reason people know about hieroglyphs is that they are on or inside the pyramids located in Egypt. 


# The Adaptation (150-250 words)

Here, I'm going to spend some time walking the audience through my adaptation. It might be wise to describe the kind of adaptation it is: **transposition, commentary, or analogue**. Think about all the analyses you've conducted this term. Most of them have been split in half. You've looked at the **formal qualities** as well as the **cultural significance** of these texts. I'm going to use an h2 (##) headings to divide this section into the two smaller subsections. 

This is also a good place to reveal your adaptation. Remember the quality of your adaptation, or let's say the "craftsmanship," is less important to us than your analysis. Think back to the sketches you made during the first week. Some of you used pencil and notebook paper. That could work here as well. Obviously, the more time and thought you put into it the better. I highly recommend that you use Canva, like I have below. Because I am at the mercy of what Canva has to offer, I may not end up with an image like the one I have in my head. That's fine. You can use this section to describe how your ideal version would be different, while the visual aid can just give us a "sense" of what you have in mind. For the same reason, please do not hesitate to upload handmade drafts or illustrations. In fact, I encourage it.

### Formal Qualities (200-300 words) 

I might consider the grid of my image, the layout, hierarchy, or even the typeface. Go back through your Slack posts and select the formal aspects of the image that you deem to be most important. I would select at least 2-3 formal qualities. It might be helpful to compare and contrast your adaptation to the original. 

### Cultural Meaning (200-300 words) 

In this section, I'm going to investigate the cultural implications of my adaptation. You might want to select a particular theorist that helps you interpret your own artifact and/or process (e.g. Foucault, Barthes, Bourdieu, Stuart Hall, De Certeau, or someone else). It's really important that you engage with key words for the text/author you choose, define that term, and use it to inform a more well-rounded cultural analysis of your own adaptation. 

# Rhetorical Significance (200-300 words) 

In short, this is a good place to examine in depth who your adaptation addresses, what it will persuade them of, and the consequence of that persuasion, i.e. your outcomes. To aid you, this might be a good place to revisit some theorists that discussed how texts subordinate audiences to mere consumers (Debord) and those who thought texts can be imancipatory or liberating (Zizek). 


# Reflection (150-250 words) 

Consider concluding with a final reflection about your process and decision making. Try answering one or more of the following questions. 

1. If someone outside this class (like your intended audience) acutally viewed your artifact, what might they think of you (the artist). Avoid answers like, "I'm a good student!" and instead, think about how your art object is a reflection of your character. 

2. If you had abundant time and resources, what would you do differently for your adaptation? 

3. In what situation outside of class/school might this project might be applicable and how so?
